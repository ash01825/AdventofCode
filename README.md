Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„âœ¨

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 solutions repository! This repository showcases my journey through Advent of Code 2024, implemented in C++. Each day features unique programming challenges designed to test and enhance problem-solving skills.

ðŸ“– About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual series of coding puzzles released daily in December. These puzzles are a fun way to learn, compete, and improve your programming expertise.

Visit the official [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) to participate and view the challenges.

ðŸš€ Getting Started

Prerequisites

Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).

Running a Solution

Navigate to a specific dayâ€™s folder and compile the solution:

g++ -std=c++17 solution.cpp -o solution && ./solution

ðŸŽ¯ Goals

	â€¢	Algorithmic Mastery: Solve each puzzle with optimal solutions.
	â€¢	Proficiency in C++: Leverage modern C++ features (C++17/20).
	â€¢	Learning & Growth: Tackle complex problems and refine coding techniques.
